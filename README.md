# Kerve Tech Test

To get started:

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Using Yarn
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm run serve

   # Using Yarn
   yarn serve
   ```

   Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.

To build an optimized version of the CSS, simply run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run production

# Using Yarn
yarn production
```

After that's done, check out `./public/build/tailwind.css` to see the optimized output.
